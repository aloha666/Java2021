## Answers:

### 1. what is a maven? pom file? dependency?build tool?

```
Apache Maven is a **software project management and comprehension tool**.

POM stands for "Project Object Model". It is an XML representation of a Maven project held in a file named pom.xml. The POM contains all necessary information about a project, as well as configurations of plugins to be used during the build process.

In Maven, dependency is another archive—JAR, ZIP, and so on—which your current project needs in order to compile, build, test, and/or to run. The dependencies are gathered in the pom.xml file, inside of a <dependencies> tag.

Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects.

```



### 2. what is a life cycle of a maven project?

```
- `validate` - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
- `compile` - compile the source code of the project
- `test` - test the compiled source code using a suitable **unit testing** framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
- `package` - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
- `verify` - run any checks on results of **integration tests** to ensure quality criteria are met
- `install` - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
- `deploy` - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
```



### 3. what is the JVM run time area contains? what each part do?

```
Heap Area: It is a shared runtime data area and stores the **actual object** in a memory. It is instantiated during the virtual machine startup. There exists one and only one heap for a running JVM process.

Method Area: It is a **logical part** of the heap area and is created on virtual machine startup. for Metadata? string pool?

Stack:A stack is created at the same time when a **thread** is created and is used to store data and partial results which will be needed while returning value for method and performing dynamic linking.Needs not to be contiguous 连续. 

Native Method Stack: A Native Method Stack stores similar data elements as a JVM Stack and it is used to help executing native (non-Java) methods. such as: start0 in thread.start();

PC Registers: Each **JVM thread** which carries out the task of a specific method has a **program counter register** associated with it. The non native method has a PC which stores the address of the available JVM instruction whereas in a native method, the value of program counter is undefined. PC register is capable of storing the return address or a native pointer on some specific platform.

```



### 4. where is a string pool store in JVM runtime data area?

### 5. what is a class class and reflction API ? - in later lectures



### 6. what is the difference between == and equals?

```
Compare with == : Will compare the reference value ( the pointed location) 

Compare with equals(Object obj) : Will call the equals method of the object (default is ==, but we can override, like String, then it will compare using the override method, for string, it compares if the chars are the same)
```



### 7. how to override the equals method?

```
need to override equals and hashCode object.
```

### 8. what is pass by value vs pass by reference?



### 9. what is the difference between list and set?

```java
List: An ordered collection. Allow duplicated(how to define? explaination in below) element. Commonly used ArrayList, LinkedList. Resize factor:0.5

Set: A collection that contains **no duplicate** elements. Sets contain no pair of elements e1 and e2 such that **e1.equals(e2)**, and at most one null element.
```



### 10. what is a concurrentHashMap and how it works?

```
multi-thread safe HashMap, use in high concurrecy situation. separate data to segement and assgin each seagemtn a lock.
get: a;; va;ie are volatile, visiable to all theads
put: find segment - lock - check - unlock
```



### 11. what is a LinkedHashMap and how it works?

```j
Maintain the insertion order of the key-value pairs. This implementation differs from HashMap in that it maintains a doubly-linked list running through all of its entries. This linked list defines the iteration ordering, which is normally the order in which keys were inserted into the map (insertion-order). Note that insertion order is not affected if a key is re-inserted into the map.
```

## Questions:

### 1. describe how a java program run

### 2. what is a class loader? 

### 4. what is auto-boxing and unboxing?

### 5. what is a wrapper class?

### 6.  what is the differece between final and static? (immutable class)

### 7. can a static method contains a static variable?

### 8. what is the differece between exception and error? 

### 9. can you catch an error?

### 10. what is garbage collector and which part of JVM it is working on?



## Answers:

### 1. describe how a java program run

```java
complier -> bytecode (.class) -> JVM -> class loader -> bytecode verification -> just in time compiler to machine code
```



### 2. what is a class loader? 

```
Class loaders are responsible for loading Java classes during runtime dynamically to the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). Also, they are part of the JRE (Java Runtime Environment). Hence, the JVM doesn't need to know about the underlying files or file systems in order to run Java programs thanks to class loaders.
```

```
Based on Classloader wikipedia there are 3 types of classloaders in JRE:

Bootstrap class loader
This class loader, which is part of the core JVM, is written in native code

Extensions class loader
It is implemented by the sun.misc.Launcher$ExtClassLoader class

System class loader
This is implemented by the sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader class

So i think in conclusion: first one is in JVM the other 2 is in JRE libraries.
```



### 4. what is auto-boxing and unboxing?

```java
autoboxing -> int to Integer  Java compiler makes between the primitive types and their corresponding object wrapper classes. 
unboxing -> Integer to int
```



### 5. what is a wrapper class?

```
A Wrapper class is a class whose object wraps or contains primitive data types. To transfter the primitive type to object.
```



### 6.  what is the differece between final and static? (immutable class)

```
The main difference between a static and final keyword is that static is keyword is used to define the class member that can be used independently of any object of that class. Final keyword is used to declare, a constant variable, a method which can not be overridden and a class that can not be inherited.

However 静态的方法可以被继承，但是不能重写。那静态方法和final method有什么区别？
```



### 7. can a static method contains a static variable?

```
You can't declare a static variable inside a method, static means that it's a variable/method of a class, it belongs to the whole class but not to one of its certain objects. This means that static keyword can be used only in a 'class scope' i.e. it doesn't have any sense inside methods.
```



### 8. what is the differece between exception and error? 

```
Error:An Error is a subclass of Throwable that indicates serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch. Most such errors are abnormal conditions.

Exception:

Checked Exception: Has to be try-catched or decleared using throws keyword on method. compile编译时检查

UnChecked Exception: Don't need to be try-catched or decleared.可以catch 但没必要， 运行时抛出

Throwable is the parent class of all exceptions and errors.
```



### 9. can you catch an error?

### 10. what is garbage collector and which part of JVM it is working on?

```
The ***heap*** is where your object data is stored. This area is then managed by the garbage collector selected at startup. Most tuning options relate to sizing the heap and choosing the most appropriate garbage collector for your situation.

Automatic garbage collection is the process of looking at heap memory, identifying which objects are in use and which are not, and deleting the unused objects. An in use object, or a referenced object, means that some part of your program still maintains a pointer to that object. An unused object, or unreferenced object, is no longer referenced by any part of your program. So the memory used by an unreferenced object can be reclaimed.

- Mark – it is where the garbage collector identifies which pieces of memory are in use and which are not
- Sweep – this step removes objects identified during the “mark” phase
```

## Answers

### 1. what is the difference between stacloverflow and out of memory?

```
stackoverflow - two many functions called in stack area
outofmemory - too much objects created in heap area
```



### 2. what is Java Generics?

```
泛型其实就是在定义类、接口、方法的时候不局限地指定某一种特定类型，而让类、接口、方法的调用者来决定具体使用哪一种类型的参数。

```

### 3. what is enum class? what is used for?

```
A *Java Enum* is a special Java type used to define **collections of constants**.
used for:Enums are used when we know all possible values at compile time.
```



### 4.  what is java annotation? 

```
Annotations provide data about a program that is **not** part of the program itself. its used as  complier, build time and runtime instructions. Examples for each?
A Java annotation can have elements for which you can set values. An element is like an attribute or parameter.
You can place Java annotations above classes, interfaces, methods, method parameters, fields and local variables.

@Deprecated – 所标注内容不再被建议使用；
@Override – 只能标注方法，表示该方法覆盖父类中的方法；

@SuppressWarnings – 所标注内容产生的警告，编译器会对这些警告保持静默；

@interface – 用于定义一个注解；**
```



### 5. what is a cusomized java annotations?

```
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/27643133 Java 注解 （Annotation）你可以这样学

@Retention – 只能被用来标注“Annotation类型”，而且它被用来指定Annotation的RetentionPolicy属性；**
			 - RetentionPolicy.SOURCE 注解只在源码阶段保留，在编译器进行编译时它将被丢弃忽视。
             - RetentionPolicy.CLASS 注解只被保留到编译进行的时候，它并不会被加载到 JVM 中。 
             - RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME 注解可以保留到程序运行的时候，它会被加载进入到 JVM 中，所以在程序运行时可以获取到它们。
@Documented --所标注内容可以出现在javadoc中；
				
@Target – 只能被用来标注“Annotation类型”，而且它被用来指定Annotation的ElementType属性；**
@Inherited – 只能被用来标注“Annotation类型”，它所标注的Annotation具有继承性；**
@Repeatable 可重复，通常是注解的值可以同时取多个。


```



### 6. what is a file class?

```
The File class is Java’s representation of a file or directory path name. Because file and directory names have different formats on different platforms, a simple string is not adequate to name them.
```



### 7. what if the difference between byete stream and character stream?

```
ByteStream: InputStream, OutputStream 它们以8-bit为单位处理数据，即字节流类读取/写入8位数据。使用这些可以存储字符，视频，音频，图像等。Byte oriented reads byte by byte.

CharacterStream: Reader, Writer 这些以16-bit Unicode处理数据。使用这些只能读取和写入**文本数据**(text files)。
```



### 8. what if the difference between file stream and buffer stream?

```
A FileInputStream obtains input bytes from a file in a file system. What files are available depends on the host environment. FileInputStream is meant for reading streams of raw bytes such as image data. 

The *Java* *BufferedInputStream* class, java.io.BufferedInputStream, provides transparent reading of **chunks of bytes** and buffering for a [Java InputStream](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-io/inputstream.html), including any subclasses of InputStream.

. **Reading larger chunks of bytes and buffering them can speed up IO quite a bit.** Rather than read one byte at a time from the network or disk, the BufferedInputStream reads **a larger block at a time into an internal buffer.*
```



### 9. why @Test is ruuning without main method?

```
with junit package, you can run method without the main method
```

## Answers

### 1. What is the difference between InputStreamReader and FileReader?

```
InputStreamReader读bytes然后转化成character，同时可以指定编码的方式(GBK, UTF-8, etc)，filereader直接读character。
InputStreamReader can handle all inout stremas( a socket, an HTTP connection, a database blob), not only files, FileReader can only reads character from a file in the file system.

"**I usually prefer using an InputStreamReader wrapping a FileInputStream to read from a file because it allows specifying a specific character encoding.**"
```

### 2. Why use char[] to read input String? Why not use a char[] size as the file size?

```java
用来减少IO inter actinons between JVM and hard disk. 比一个一个读要快
```

### 3. what is a flush()? what is a close()?

```
**flush():** Flushes the output stream and forces any buffered output bytes to be written out. 
**close():** always close a buffer after use.
```



### 4. What is an objectstream?

```
objectstream is the bytestrem of object, if it is not serizalized, it will be unreadable after input.
```



### 5. What is a serilizable Interface? What is a serialVerisionUID?

```
serilizable Interface: serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream. 

Serialization is done using ObjectOutputStream. Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory. This mechanism is used to persist the object. Deserialization is done using ObjectInputStream.
注意：Serialization 用 ObjectOutputStream， Deserialization 用 ObjectInputStream
序列化：对象的寿命通常随着生成该对象的程序的终止而终止，有时候需要把在内存中的各种对象的状态（也就是实例变量，不是方法）保存下来，并且可以在需要时再将对象恢复。虽然你可以用你自己的各种各样的方法来保存对象的状态，但是Java给你提供一种应该比你自己的好的保存对象状态的机制，那就是序列化。
```



### 6. What is the transient and static keyword in serialiable interface?

```java
static: variable will be not saved after Serialization
trasient: variable will be not saved after Serialization, but it is not a static varibale/method. used when static is not suitable
    

```



### 7. serialVerisionUID is static, how can it pass to object stream?

```
 UID is static but is also passed in the bytestream, it is an exception.
```

### 8. What is a Lambda Expression?

```
one line statement, a simpified anonymous method. can be used as an argument in the functional interface.
```

### 9. can a lambda expression change the parameter value?

```
No
```

### 10.  what is the difference between a lambda expression and an annoymouns class?

```
the this keyword in annoymouns class is point to the class iteself, while the this keyword in lambad expresiion is point to the class using lambda exprssion.
```



### 11. what is a functional interface?

```
Functional interface is a kind of interface that has **only 1 abstract method**.

Functional Interface是指带有 @FunctionalInterface 注解的interface。它的特点是其中只有一个子类必须要实现的abstract方法。如果abstract方法前面带有default关键字，则不做计算。其实这个也很好理解，因为Functional Interface改写成为lambda表达式之后，并没有指定实现的哪个方法，如果有多个方法需要实现的话，就会有问题。
```

### 12.what is the four typical functional interface? and How they work?（小抄）

```
function<T,R>: apply(T) method 作用：使用传入的lambda expression 对传入数据T（一般是collection)进行操作，返回结果R。有进有出
Consumer<T>: accept(T) method 作用：接受传入参数T，不返回。只进不出，
Predicate<T>: test(T) method 作用：使用传入的lambda expression 对传入数据T（一般是collection)进行判断 返回真假
Supplier<T>： get() method 作用：不传入参数，返回一个指定的T值（类如randomInt）不劳而获
```



### 13. What is a stream API and what it can do?

```
//https://stackify.com/streams-guide-java-8/

A stream does not store data and, in that sense, is not a data structure. It also never modifies the underlying data source.This functionality – java.util.stream – supports functional-style operations on streams of elements, such as map-reduce transformations on collections.

 A steam is a list will not save the element by it will do the calculation when needed.
 
基本method：
forEach：it loops over the stream elements, calling the supplied function on each element.
map: produces a new stream after applying a function to each element of the original stream
collect: its one of the common ways to get stuff out of the stream once we are done with all the processing
filter： this produces a new stream that contains elements of the original stream that pass a given test (specified by a Predicate).

```



### 14. what is the output of a stream? 中间操作？终端操作？

```
intermediate operations:intermediate operations such as filter() return a new stream on which further processing can be done.

terminal operations:erminal operations, such as forEach(), mark the stream as consumed, after which point it can no longer be used further.
```

### 1. what ia an optional function?

```
optional function is to **prevent NullpointerExcenption**.

methods: 

isPresent(): check optional instance is empty or not

of(object): pop out nullpointerexception if object is null

ofNullable(object): accept null value if object is null
```



### 2. what is a thread? what is multi-threading? why we need multithreading?

```
A theard is a minimum processing unit in a java process, a process is a an execution of a program, OS will assgin memory for each process. We need multithreading to achieve multi-tasking, and better ultulation of the CPUs, provide better user expericence.
```

### what is concurrency, what its relactionship with multi-thread （必考）

```
Concurrency is the ability of your program to deal (not doing) with many things at once and is achieved through multithreading. 
To recap, concurrency refers to how a single CPU can make progress on multiple tasks seemingly at the same time (AKA concurrently).
***Concurrency*** means that an application is making progress on more than one task - at the same time or at least seemingly at the same time (concurrently).
```

### 3. How to create a thread? what is the different between a callable interface and a runnable interface?

```
4ways
**1.extend thread class**

**2.implement runnable interface**

## Answers:

### 1. what is a transaction?

```sql
is an action or series of actions carried out by a user or application, which reads or writes the contents of a database.
```

### 2. what is a ACID of transaction?

```sql
A: atomtic, a trascation cannot be partillay done.
C: consistancy, trasactions take database from one consisteent state into another
I: isolation, the effect of a trasaction is not visiable to other trasaction until it is done.
D: durabilty, once transcition is done, the changes are permanent 
```



### 3. what is a rollback? what is a commit?

```sql
rollback: abort a trancision, database back to the status before transition.
commit: finish a traciion, the changes are permanent.
```



### 4. what is a dirty read? what is an unrepeatable read? what is a phantom read?

```java
dirty read: read UNCOMMITED data from another transaction (NO WRITE LOCK)
unrepeatable read: read COMMITED data from an update query from another transaction (NO READ LOCK)
phantom read: read COMMITED data from an insert query from another transcation (NO RANGE LOCK)
```



### 5. what is the isolation levels? on each level, what is the restraints? 

```sql
Transactions specify an isolation level that defines the degree to which one transaction must be isolated from resource or data modifications made by other transactions.

read uncommited: dirty read (Y), unrepeatable read (Y), phantom read (Y).

read commited: dirty read (N), unrepeatable read (Y), phantom read (Y).

repeatable read: dirty read (N), unrepeatable read (N), phantom read (Y).

serizaliable: dirty read (N), unrepeatable read (N), phantom read (N). all transactions will   execute in a certain schedule.

The higher the isolation, the more locks requires, the more slower.
```



### 6. what is the types of lock? what is a binay lock / sharded lock / exclusive lock?

```sql
binary lock: 1 means locked, 0 means unlocked.

shared lock: read lock 大家都只能读不能写, are shared by the trasctions with the same opreations
exculsive lock: write lock, 独占，只有lock holder可以读和写.其他no access.
```



### 7. what is a read lock? what is a write lock?

### 8.  what is a range lock?

```sql
used for serilizeable isolation. 

是一种加在两个索引之间的**锁**，或者加在第一个索引之前，或最后一个索引之后的间隙。 有时候又称为**范围锁**（**Range Locks**），这个**范围**可以跨一个索引记录，多个索引记录，甚至是空的。 使用间隙**锁**可以防止其他事务在这个**范围**内插入或修改记录，**保证两次读取这个范围内的记录不会变**，从而不会出现幻读现象。虽然解决了幻读问题，但是数据库的并发性一样受到了影响.
```

### 9. what lock required for each isolation level?

```sql
read uncommited: No Lock.

read commited: Continuous read lock, temproily write lock.

repeatable read: Continuous read lock, Continuous  write lock.

serizaliable: range lock or other table-level lock.
```



### 10. what is a dead lock? how to prevent a dead lock?

```sql
both transactions wait for other to release a lock. it happen when a cycle is detect in a wait for graph.

? to prevent dead lock, one method is to use a conservative 2PL, or put a time limit on the wait(), make it wait-die or wound -wait.
```



### 11. what is  optimitic lock? how to achieve an optimistic lock?

```sql
an optomistic lock means the transcation is optimistic, and will not put a lock on data, instead  the trascation will check the status of the database when update, if the status is consistant, the update will be done, other way it will be aborted.

two ways to implement: 
1.version number
2.time stamp
```



### 12. what is pessimistic lock? how to achieve and prssimistic lock?

```sql
a pessimistci lock means the transcation is pessimistic, it always assume the data will be update by others, thus it will keep the lock unitil the trascation is finised.

Java synchrozied is a typical type of pessimistic lock, the lock is required at everytime and there can be only one thread making changes on the database, other thread will be blocked.
```
