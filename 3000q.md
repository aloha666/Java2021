## Answers:

### 1. what is a transaction?

```sql
is an action or series of actions carried out by a user or application, which reads or writes the contents of a database.
```

### 2. what is a ACID of transaction?

```sql
A: atomtic, a trascation cannot be partillay done.
C: consistancy, trasactions take database from one consisteent state into another
I: isolation, the effect of a trasaction is not visiable to other trasaction until it is done.
D: durabilty, once transcition is done, the changes are permanent 
```



### 3. what is a rollback? what is a commit?

```sql
rollback: abort a trancision, database back to the status before transition.
commit: finish a traciion, the changes are permanent.
```



### 4. what is a dirty read? what is an unrepeatable read? what is a phantom read?

```java
dirty read: read UNCOMMITED data from another transaction (NO WRITE LOCK)
unrepeatable read: read COMMITED data from an update query from another transaction (NO READ LOCK)
phantom read: read COMMITED data from an insert query from another transcation (NO RANGE LOCK)
```



### 5. what is the isolation levels? on each level, what is the restraints? 

```sql
Transactions specify an isolation level that defines the degree to which one transaction must be isolated from resource or data modifications made by other transactions.

read uncommited: dirty read (Y), unrepeatable read (Y), phantom read (Y).

read commited: dirty read (N), unrepeatable read (Y), phantom read (Y).

repeatable read: dirty read (N), unrepeatable read (N), phantom read (Y).

serizaliable: dirty read (N), unrepeatable read (N), phantom read (N). all transactions will   execute in a certain schedule.

The higher the isolation, the more locks requires, the more slower.
```



### 6. what is the types of lock? what is a binay lock / sharded lock / exclusive lock?

```sql
binary lock: 1 means locked, 0 means unlocked.

shared lock: read lock 大家都只能读不能写, are shared by the trasctions with the same opreations
exculsive lock: write lock, 独占，只有lock holder可以读和写.其他no access.
```



### 7. what is a read lock? what is a write lock?

### 8.  what is a range lock?

```sql
used for serilizeable isolation. 

是一种加在两个索引之间的**锁**，或者加在第一个索引之前，或最后一个索引之后的间隙。 有时候又称为**范围锁**（**Range Locks**），这个**范围**可以跨一个索引记录，多个索引记录，甚至是空的。 使用间隙**锁**可以防止其他事务在这个**范围**内插入或修改记录，**保证两次读取这个范围内的记录不会变**，从而不会出现幻读现象。虽然解决了幻读问题，但是数据库的并发性一样受到了影响.
```

### 9. what lock required for each isolation level?

```sql
read uncommited: No Lock.

read commited: Continuous read lock, temproily write lock.

repeatable read: Continuous read lock, Continuous  write lock.

serizaliable: range lock or other table-level lock.
```



### 10. what is a dead lock? how to prevent a dead lock?

```sql
both transactions wait for other to release a lock. it happen when a cycle is detect in a wait for graph.

? to prevent dead lock, one method is to use a conservative 2PL, or put a time limit on the wait(), make it wait-die or wound -wait.
```



### 11. what is  optimitic lock? how to achieve an optimistic lock?

```sql
an optomistic lock means the transcation is optimistic, and will not put a lock on data, instead  the trascation will check the status of the database when update, if the status is consistant, the update will be done, other way it will be aborted.

two ways to implement: 
1.version number
2.time stamp
```



### 12. what is pessimistic lock? how to achieve and prssimistic lock?

```sql
a pessimistci lock means the transcation is pessimistic, it always assume the data will be update by others, thus it will keep the lock unitil the trascation is finised.

Java synchrozied is a typical type of pessimistic lock, the lock is required at everytime and there can be only one thread making changes on the database, other thread will be blocked.
```
